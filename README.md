Using the forEach function defined for an array to find the sum of the array of numbers. 

JavaScript program to convert temperatures to and from celsius, fahrenheit.

Factorial function that returns the factorial of a given number, n.

Javascript function that converts a given amount of money into coins of denominations (1, 2, 5, 10 and 25). 

Javascript function which takes a string argument and returns the reversed string.

Comparator function to sort a javascript array of objects.

Javascript function which takes an array (in this case a sparse array) as argument and returns the number of elements in that array (as opposed to the array.length method).

Constructor functions and prototype: examples and:
